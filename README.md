# My NVIM configuration

> Tip
> I really like web dev so this configuration is focus on that stuff anyway everything have been well documented so you can take it just a model if you want to make your own config check about ["CoC"](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) if want to add more languages support; .js and .py are using [Kite](https://www.kite.com/)

## Quick Start

If you don't know to much about vim or nvim just follow the next steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndresMpa/My-NVIM-configuration.git
$ mv /My-NVIM-configuration nvim
$ mv /nvim ~/.config
$ nvim
```

Being on neovim just make the following commands to install the plugins and that stuff (You may need to install [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))

- space + p + i
- esc
- :source%
- :CocInstall

That's it, now it should work
